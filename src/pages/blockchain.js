    <h1>About </h1>
    <p> Blockchain technology is known for being responsible for recording transactions on the Bitcoin network. </p> 
    <p>The premises of this technology are decentralization, data immutability, transparency, and scalability. </p>
   <p>These characteristics have contributed to the adoption of Blockchain by businesses, industries, financial institutions, and governments.  </p>
   <p>In 2017 some companies in the retail sector, in partnership with IBM, developed projects to implement Blockchain technology.  </p>
   <p>The initiative aims to optimize monitoring and control processes, collecting information about products at each stage of the
  supply chain, meeting legal and environmental requirements.  </p>
   <p>Our proposal is to offer a service platform to act in the cryptography market, offering specialized services for companies and Blockchain technology users, 
  besides developing Blockchain solutions based on information architecture, information security and data distribution.  </p>
   <p>Our team is composed of technology professionals such as Programmers, Web Designers, Project Analysts, and Project Manager.  </p>
   <p>The organizational system is based on Holocracy, this system allows governance to be distributed to the teams, enabling employees to make proposals or define rules through voting.
